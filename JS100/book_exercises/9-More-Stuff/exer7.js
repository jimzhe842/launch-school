// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// exception handling helps us anticipate an error. 
// it uses a try/catch statement
// the "try" block runs some code that may result in an error (aka catch exceptions)
// if an error occurs, the "catch" block runs some code i.e. a console log with a description of the error
// can prevent larger or future bugs
